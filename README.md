# VACUUM

Fly your rock around and try and gain mass by bumping into things of a similar mass to you, watch out though some things are beyond your grasp until you grow enough.

This is the start of an ambient game, it needs a lot of love but it gets the idea across.

## Requirments

- at least GL 3.3
- sdl2
- sdl2-mixer
- libdevil

## Notes

This thing does no batching or culling and  so kicks off stupid numbers of draw calls. Sorry about that, I spent too much time wrestling with some bugs to fix that.
